This project processes a video file of a meeting, to pull out the key moments of the meeting, and key takeaways.

The processing steps are:
1. Extract the audio from the video file
2. Transcribe the audio to subtitles
3. Extract the key moments from the subtitles with their timecodes.
4. Extract the key takeaways for each key moment of the meeting
5. Re-write the video file with the key moments as chapters
6. Write a webpage with the key moments and takeaways, with links to the video file at their timecodes.

The project will be implemented in Python and use:
- ffmpeg for video and audio processing
- insanely fast whisper for the transcription
- ollama for the key moments extraction and key takeaway summarization
- flask for the webpage generation

The project will be implemented in a modular way, so that each step can be run independently, and the project can be run from any step.
