This project processes a video file of a meeting, to pull out the key moments of the meeting, and key takeaways.

The processing steps are:
1. Extract the audio from the video file
2. Transcribe the audio to subtitles
3. Extract key moments, takeaways, and a short topic with timecode from the subtitles.
4. Re-write the video file with the topic as chapters
5. Write a webpage with topic heading, key moments, takeaways, and link to the video file at their timecodes.

The project will be implemented in Python and use:
- ffmpeg for video and audio processing
- insanely fast whisper for the transcription
- ollama for the key moments extraction and key takeaway summarization
- flask for the webpage generation

The project will be implemented in a modular way, so that each step can be run independently, and the project can be run from any step.
